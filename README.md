*** Speech Therapy:

        Users are given different words per day and they have to  use the webcam facilities to say the word. Pronunciation is evaluated live time and user can view the accuracy level.If they got the word wrong,then we provide parallels between the actual lip and tongue movement for the syllables and what's done by the user. This way, they can detect the errors in their ways.

*** Fun and interactive Learning Approach:
       It is designed in the form of games where user has to pass each level.And if they are stuck on a single level for a long time, our video personnel will contact you and personally guide you.
